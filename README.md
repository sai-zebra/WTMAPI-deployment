##  About The Project

The MyWork API is the primary interface for workforce-facing applications within the Workcloud ecosystem. It empowers employees by giving them access to critical tasks, communication feeds, and performance surveys. The core design goal is to provide a clean, decoupled, and highly maintainable codebase that can evolve over time without accumulating technical debt.

### Key Features

*   **Feeds Management**: Create, list, update, and delete feed items.
*   **Feed Notes**: Add and manage notes associated with specific feed items.
*   **Feed Operations**: Perform state-changing actions like `CLAIM`, `ACKNOWLEDGE`, and `COMPLETE`.
*   **Surveys**: Create and submit responses for workforce surveys.
*   **Real-Time Management (RTM)**: Execute real-time operations like broadcasting messages.
*   **User Management**: Manage user profiles and assets.
*   **Session Tracking**: Log user login and logout events.

## Core Architecture

##  Overall Architecture: The Modular Monolith

This project is architected as a **Modular Monolith**. Instead of a single, undifferentiated codebase, the application is partitioned into a set of loosely-coupled modules, where each module represents a distinct business capability (e.g., "User Management", "Feeds", "Surveys").

### Architectural Principles

*   **High Cohesion**: Each module encapsulates a specific part of the business domain.
*   **Low Coupling**: Modules communicate through well-defined public APIs (e.g., Java interfaces or events), not by accessing each other's internal implementation details. This prevents the system from becoming a tangled "big ball of mud".
*   **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different modules in parallel with minimal friction.
*   **Clear Boundaries**: The separation between business domains is made explicit in the codebase structure.

This approach provides many of the benefits of microservices (like clear boundaries and scalability of development) while avoiding the operational complexity of a distributed system.

---

##  Module Architecture: The Hexagonal Approach

Within each module described above, we apply the **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters). This pattern places the module's core business logic and domain at its center, completely isolated from external technologies and delivery mechanisms.

### Hexagonal Principles

*   **The Core is King**: The central hexagon contains pure, framework-independent business logic, domain models, and port interfaces. This is the heart of the module.
*   **Ports as Explicit Contracts**: Simple Java interfaces (Ports) define the contract for how the core logic interacts with the outside world.
*   **Adapters as Implementation Details**: Adapters implement the ports, connecting the core to external technologies like web frameworks (Spring MVC), databases (JPA/Hibernate), or message brokers.

This decoupling ensures that each module's core logic can be tested in isolation and that its technical dependencies can be swapped out with minimal impact.

This project defines the external API for the **Workcloud Task Management – MyWork** service. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive set of tools for the workforce to manage their tasks, communications, and user profiles.

The API exposes the following core capabilities:

*   **Centralized Task & Feed Management**:
    *   Allows employees to view, create, and manage their work items, presented as "Feeds."
    *   Supports the full lifecycle of a task, including operations like claiming, reassigning, acknowledging, and completing work.

*   **Communication & Collaboration**:
    *   Enables users to add, update, and delete contextual notes on specific feeds, facilitating clear communication around tasks.

*   **Real-Time Management (RTM)**:
    *   Provides endpoints for supervisors or managers to perform real-time actions, such as sending surveys, broadcasting messages, or nudging employees.

*   **Feedback & Data Collection**:
    *   Includes a survey system that allows for the creation of surveys and the submission of responses from the workforce.

*   **User & Profile Management**:
    *   Handles essential user-centric functions, including managing user accounts, sessions (login/logout), and personal assets like profile images.

## System Design & Engineering Practices

This project emphasizes professional software engineering practices for building resilient and maintainable systems.

### Robust Error Handling Strategy

Our error handling provides a predictable, consistent experience for API consumers and aligns perfectly with the hexagonal design:

1.  **Business Exceptions in the Core**: The core application logic defines and throws specific, custom exceptions (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException`, `InvalidFeedOperationException`) when a business rule is violated.
2.  **Global Exception Handling in the Web Adapter**: A centralized `@ControllerAdvice` intercepts all exceptions. It translates business exceptions into standardized, client-friendly JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes, while logging server-side errors for investigation.

**Example Standardized Error Response (`404 Not Found`):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-29T14:24:35.418Z",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Feed item with ID '123-abc-456' could not be found.",
  "path": "/mywork/v1/feeds/123-abc-456"
}
```

---

##  Project Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy is centered around comprehensive **Unit Testing**, leveraging the clean separation provided by the Hexagonal Architecture. This ensures that the core business logic, the most critical part of our application, is robust, correct, and reliable.

### Unit Tests: The Foundation

*   **Purpose**: To validate the core business logic and domain rules in complete isolation from any external dependencies or frameworks (like the web layer or database).

*   **Scope**:
    *   **What is tested**: All classes within the `core` package of each module. This includes `services`, `domain` objects, and any custom business `exceptions`.
    *   **How it's tested**: Outbound ports (interfaces to the database, message brokers, etc.) are replaced with "test doubles" or "mocks". This allows us to simulate any external behavior and verify that our core logic behaves correctly under all conditions.

*   **Key Benefits**:
    *   **Speed**: These tests execute in milliseconds because they don't require starting a Spring context, spinning up a database, or making network calls.
    *   **Precision**: When a test fails, it points directly to a bug in the business logic, not an issue with configuration or external infrastructure.
    *   **Architectural Enforcement**: Writing tests for the core forces developers to respect the architectural boundaries and keep the business logic pure and framework-independent.

*   **Technology**:
    *   **JUnit 5**: The primary framework for writing tests.
    *   **Mockito**: Used to create mock implementations of our outbound port interfaces.

To run the full suite of unit tests, use the following command:

*Using Maven:*
```sh
mvn test
```
---

### Security First Design

Security is a primary concern, implemented via **Spring Security**.

*   **Authentication**: The API is secured using **HTTP Basic Authentication**. Clients must send a valid, Base64-encoded username and password in the `Authorization` header with each request.
*   **Authorization**: Endpoint access is controlled by user roles. Access is enforced declaratively using method-level annotations (e.g., `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")`) or configured centrally for URL patterns.
*   **Configuration**: All security rules, CORS policies, and public endpoints (like `/actuator/health`) are defined in a dedicated `SecurityConfig` class for clear and centralized management.
*   **Stateless by Design**: As a REST API, the service is stateless. CSRF protection is disabled, as it is not needed for the non-browser-based clients this API is intended for.

### Configuration Management

The application uses **Spring Profiles** to manage environment-specific configurations. This allows for different settings for local development and production without changing the code.

All property files are located in the `application/src/main/resources/` directory.

---

#### `application.properties` (Common Properties)

This file contains properties that are shared across all environments. It's a good place for the application name, database dialect, and connection pool settings.

```properties
# Application name
spring.application.name=application

# JPA / Hibernate Settings
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# Default Hikari Connection Pool Settings
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=3
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=1
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=300000

```

### Logging & Observability

To provide visibility into the application's state, especially for debugging in a live environment, the following features are configured:

*   **Standard Logging**: The application utilizes Spring Boot's default logging framework (Logback). Log output is sent to the console and can be configured in `application.properties` to adjust log levels for specific packages, helping to trace issues without restarting the application.

*   **Live Diagnostics with Spring Boot Actuator**: For real-time debugging and inspection, **Spring Boot Actuator** is configured to expose a wide range of internal endpoints. This provides a direct window into the running application to check its health, view metrics, understand the environment, and more.

*   **Exposed Endpoints for Debugging**: By setting `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`, all Actuator endpoints are made available. This is intentionally done to aid in production debugging. Some of the key endpoints include:
    *   `/actuator/health`: Provides a simple up/down status of the application and its connections (e.g., to the database).
    *   `/actuator/env`: Displays the current environment properties, showing exactly what configuration the application is running with.
    *   `/actuator/metrics`: Allows you to view a list of available metrics and inspect their current values (e.g., `jvm.memory.used`, `hikaricp.connections.active`).
    *   `/actuator/httptrace`: Shows a trace of the last 100 HTTP request-response pairs, which is invaluable for debugging unexpected client or server behavior.
